# Maintaining this repository

Update the documents a change affects, not every document. Keep IDs stable and history visible.

| When | Update |
|---|---|
| A feature is proposed | a new `features/FEAT-nn-….md`; its matrix rows `planned` |
| A feature is built or changes behaviour | its feature file; the matrix rows (status, code, tests, evidence); screen sections; screenshots; the changelog |
| A business rule changes | never edit a source's extracted text; record the change in the feature file and in `requirements/open_questions.md` or an ADR |
| An API or data model changes | `architecture/`, the feature file |
| A requirement is removed or superseded | keep its row; its status and note say so; an ADR says why |
| A defect reveals an undocumented rule | the rule in the feature file; a `DEF-nn` in `testing/regression_coverage.md` while open |
| A decision changes the architecture | a new ADR; the old one marked superseded |
| A new version of a source arrives | register it as a new row in `sources/README.md`; extract the differences; keep the old extraction |
| The suite is run for a change | a row in `testing/regression_coverage.md` with the real result |
| A milestone is planned, or a card moves | nothing by hand: the engine rewrites `board/`; a plan changes through `operonx-project replan` |

Always: one line in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md), then `operonx-project brd check`.

Rules: state facts only with a source (a source section, a code path, a test, a measurement); mark assumptions
and proposals as such; never cite an illustrative image or a mock figure as evidence. A private source is never
committed: it is registered by path and hash only.
